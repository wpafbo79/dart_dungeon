# Overview

This is a small exploratory project using [Dart](https://dart.dev/) to create random dungeon layouts.  While doing research on algorithms for randomly placing rooms and connecting them, I came across Bob Nystromâ€™s [page](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/) describing his use of Dart to create a dungeon game, [Hauberk](https://github.com/munificent/hauberk), on which he was working.  Never having used Dart before, I started looking into the language and was intrigued enough to give it a try.

This page is primarily intended to be my working notes for [getting started](2021/03/09/getting_started.html) with Dart and my research on random dungeon generation.
